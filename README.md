This is a simple HTML website that displays recipes of my favorite foods.
The home page has internal links to a different page for each recipe. Each recipe page
will have images of the dish and a list of ingredients and steps for cooking it. I hope to 
learn how to properly use headings, lists, links, and images in HTML and how 
to use Git/Github better.
