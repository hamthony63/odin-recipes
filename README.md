# odin-recipes
In this project, I will create a simple HTML website that displays recipes of my favorite foods.
This home page will have internal links to a different page for each recipe. In the recipe page, 
there will be images of the finished food, a list of ingredients and steps for cooking it. I hope to 
learn how to properly use headings, lists, links, and images in HTML. I also hope to learn on how 
to use Git/Github better.
